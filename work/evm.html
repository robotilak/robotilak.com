     Vending machine : 
		<p style="text-align:left"> We designed, developed and fabricated an egg vending machine for Central Poultry Development Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries 
			tied up with VIT University. This vending mactire machine was based on five new mechanisms unique to vending machine. 
			This was built primarily for the government with the idea to empower the farmer to use this machine to vend their own product.
			This vending machine is first of its kind and is operable in less than 350 Watts with a storage capacity of 600-720 eggs and can dispense any packaged product weighing 1kg. Currently the government of Chandigarh has shown interest to install 200 such machines are being remodeled for industrial implementation.
